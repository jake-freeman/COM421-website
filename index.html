      <h2>What are we? What is our purpose?</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Universities are integral to the success of society. They foster academic excellence and personal growth. University campuses are seen as the safest areas to be as a student. When a crime occurs on campus or near campus that perception is questioned. Crimes affect not just the parties involved, but everyone on or around campus. Students become fearful of being on campus, which may be their primary residence most of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
        By collecting data regarding crimes in and around University campuses accross the United States any potential public safety issues regarding these Univeristies can be brought to light.
