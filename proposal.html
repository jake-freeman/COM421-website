    <h1><a id="Project_Summary_0"></a>Project Summary</h1>
    <p>We propose to demonstrate the level of violent crimes (including robbery) in and around the IIT campus and create a contrast with other universities in similar high-crime areas. The collected data will be analyzed to show how the universities chosen compare with crime that occurs on campus versus off campus.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container background-light">
    <h1><a id="Project_Description_3"></a>Project Description</h1>
    <h2><a id="Rationale_and_Significance_4"></a>Rationale and Significance</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this project is to highlight potential public safety issues for universities in high-crime areas and how these types of universities compare with one another. Showing how these universities compare to each other relative to their local crime rates could bring potential public safety issues to light. This, in turn, could potentially lead to proposed solutions to better public safety.</p>

    <h2><a id="Plan_of_Work_7"></a>Plan of Work</h2>
    <h3><a id="Scope_9"></a>Scope</h3>
    <p>Violent crime and burglary/theft incidents in and around IIT and other college campuses in high-crime areas (i.e. Detroit, St. Louis, South LA, etc.). The project will ignore non-violent personal crimes like traffic violations, drug possession, or non-violent public disturbances. The focus will be on universities within the United States.</p>

    <h3><a id="Methods_12"></a>Methods</h3>
    <p>We will acquire data from city crime databases and focus on the crime within a one mile radius of a university. Students want to feel safe around campus and we think students want to know what the crime rate is around campus, and what university security is doing to reduce it.</p>

    <h3><a id="Problem_Analysis_35"></a>Problem Analysis</h3>
    <p>One workflow problem we might encounter is that some cities do not give public access to crime data. To address this issue, we will look at as many high crime locations as possible, hopefully ensuring enough varied and fair data for the study.</p>

    <h2><a id="Facilities_and_Equipment_38"></a>Facilities and Equipment</h2>
    <p>No additional equipment will be needed to complete the project. Data needed includes location based crime reports for areas around these universities in the past decade or so. While most cities have this data readily available, not being able to access this data may prevent some universities from being studied.</p>

    <h1><a id="Conclusion_54"></a>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>To conclude, crime is an issue that all universities face, but those in higher crime areas face more than others. Public safety is not always enough, and the effectiveness of it should be monitored and adjusted as needed to ensure the safety of students and faculty. It is important to recognize where public safety efforts go right and where they go wrong, so that such systems can be improved. Thank you for taking the time to read this proposal, and we hope you like where our project is headed.</p>
